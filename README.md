# Surface Crack Detection

Surface Crack Detection tackles the problem of manual defect identification in construction and manufacturing by automating the process with deep learning. Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the project classifies images into **Crack (Positive)** and **No Crack (Negative)** categories, streamlining defect monitoring and ensuring structural safety.

1. Clone the project:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/UmarSkh/Surface-Crack-Detection.git
```

2. Upload kaggle.json to Colab and move it to the ~/.kaggle/ folder:

```
from google.colab import files
files.upload()
!mkdir -p ~/.kaggle
!cp kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/
!chmod 600 ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
```

3. Download and unzip the dataset:

```
!kaggle datasets download -d arunrk7/surface-crack-detection
!unzip -q surface-crack-detection.zip -d surface-crack-detection
```

4. Open and run the notebook to train the CNN.

## Lessons Learned

This project deepened my understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks, data pipelines, and evaluation metrics in image classification. I gained hands-on experience with TensorFlow/Keras, managing Kaggle datasets via API, and visualizing training dynamics with Matplotlib/Plotly. Additionally, I strengthened my skills in handling imbalanced datasets, preventing overfitting with early stopping, and testing models on unseen real-world data.
